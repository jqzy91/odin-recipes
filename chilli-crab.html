    <h2>One of Singapore's National Dishes</h2>
    <p>
      Chilli crab has been promoted by the Singapore Tourism Board as one of
      Singapore's national dishes, and can be found in seafood restaurants all
      over the island. It is traditionally eaten with bare hands as a means to
      savour the juicy crab meat with its sweet and spicy chilli sauce.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the crab by removing the base flap, then pull off the head and
        clear out the cavity. Keep the head in a bowl. Moving to the body of the
        crab, remove the gills, which are an opaque brown colour on both sides
        of the crab. Using a sharp knife, cut the crab in half down the middle,
        then divide into six parts. Using the knife, crack the crab legs open to
        allow the flavours to enhance while cooking. Add to the bowl with the
        head then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a food processor, add shallots, ginger, red chillies, garlic,
        ketchup, and shrimp paste, then pulse until it comes together and forms
        a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a wok over medium heat, then once it comes up to temperature
        fry add the chilli paste and cook for five minutes, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crab pieces into the wok and stir until they are fully coated.
        Give the crab time to start turning orange, approximately 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato puree, chicken stock, rice wine vinegar, sweet chilli
        sauce, soy sauce and palm sugar, then stir until completely mixed. The
        crab should be fully orange by now. Add a lid on top and allow the
        mixture to simmer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the crab legs and head, and plate up on a shallow dish.</li>
      <li>
        Add butter, spring onions, and egg. Let the egg sit for a minute before
        stirring, then give the sauce a quick stir. The sauce should thicken up
        quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the sauce on top of the crab and garnish with a few sprigs of
        coriander.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
